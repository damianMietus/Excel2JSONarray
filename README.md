# Excel2JSONarray
A program that converts a column of text cells into a JSON array. 

# Motivation
The reason for the creation of this program was that I wanted a way to take large sets of data, manipulate their data, and convert them into a .json array without doing it by hand.

# Features
This program includes other features such as:
- Option to reformat cell text to lowercase or uppercase
- Adjust how many array items are on each line
- Automatically works down a column until it finds an empty cell

# Author
Developed by Damian Mietus, using Python 2.7.10, with Tkinter and Openpyxl
